# Job Board UI - Frontend Intern Assignment

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack:
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Local JSON API

## ðŸ§© Features:
- List of jobs from mock API
- Dynamic job details page
- Responsive and styled with Tailwind
- Dark mode toggle (bonus)

## ðŸ“‚ Setup Instructions:
1. Clone this repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000`

## ðŸ’¡ My Approach:
I built the app using Next.js and Tailwind for a clean, responsive UI. Jobs are rendered from a static JSON file, simulating a backend API. The dynamic route handles job details rendering, and a dark mode toggle enhances the UX. The component-based architecture ensures reusability and clarity.
